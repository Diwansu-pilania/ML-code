Data Preparation Improvements
Handling Missing Values:
You are replacing missing categorical values with the mode and continuous values with the mean. While this is a common approach, consider using more advanced imputation techniques such as KNNImputer or regression models for better results.

Example:

python
Copy
Edit
from sklearn.impute import KNNImputer

imputer = KNNImputer(n_neighbors=5)
df_test_imputed = imputer.fit_transform(df_test)
Mapping Errors:
In your data mapping, the nan string is mapped incorrectly for Material, Style, etc. You should instead handle these with actual np.nan.

Drop Irrelevant Columns:
After mapping and cleaning, ensure columns like id do not inadvertently affect model predictions.

Model Training Enhancements
RandomForest Parameters:
Your current setting max_depth=10 and n_estimators=10 for RandomForestRegressor might underfit the data. Increase n_estimators to at least 100 for better performance.

Example:

python
Copy
Edit
rf = RandomForestRegressor(n_estimators=100, max_depth=20, random_state=42)
Model Performance Evaluation:
Include metrics to evaluate your models like:

Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
Mean Squared Error (MSE)
ùëÖ
2
R 
2
  score
Example:

python
Copy
Edit
from sklearn.metrics import mean_absolute_error, mean_squared_error, r2_score

predictions = rf.predict(x)
print("MAE:", mean_absolute_error(y, predictions))
print("MSE:", mean_squared_error(y, predictions))
print("R2 Score:", r2_score(y, predictions))
Additional Tips
Normalize or standardize continuous columns if necessary to improve model performance.
Validate models using cross-validation (cross_val_score) to ensure robustness.
Hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV or RandomizedSearchCV will help find the optimal parameters.
